 * {@link java.util.concurrent.CountDownLatch} Java class to synchronize your

 * Any thread, usually main thread of application, which calls
 * {@link java.util.concurrent.CountDownLatch#await()} will wait until count
 * reaches zero or its interrupted by another thread. All other thread are
 * required to do count down by calling
 * {@link java.util.concurrent.CountDownLatch#countDown()} once they are
 * completed or ready. <br>
 * As soon as count reaches zero, Thread awaiting starts running. One of the
 * disadvantage of {@link java.util.concurrent.CountDownLatch} is that it's not
 * reusable once the count reaches to zero you can not use
 * {@link java.util.concurrent.CountDownLatch} any more. <br>
 * <br>
 * Use {@link java.util.concurrent.CountDownLatch} when one thread, like main
 * thread, require to wait for one or more threads to complete, before it can
 * start processing. <br>
 * <br>
 * Classical example of using {@link java.util.concurrent.CountDownLatch} in
 * Java is any server side core Java application which uses services
 * architecture, where multiple services are provided by multiple threads and
 * application can not start processing until all services have started
 * successfully. <br>

/**
 * CountDownLatch works in latch principle, main thread will wait until Gate is
 * open. One thread waits for n number of threads specified while creating
 * CountDownLatch in Java. Any thread, usually main thread of application, which
 * calls CountDownLatch.await() will wait until count reaches zero or its
 * interrupted by another Thread. All other thread are required to do count down
 * by calling CountDownLatch.countDown() once they are completed or ready to the
 * job. as soon as count reaches zero, Thread awaiting starts running. One of
 * the disadvantage of CountDownLatch is that its not reusable once count
 * reaches to zero you can not use CountDownLatch any more, but don't worry Java
 * concurrency API has another concurrent utility called CyclicBarrier for such
 * requirements.
 */

/**
 * Few points about Java CountDownLatch which is worth remembering: 
 * 1) You can
 * not reuse CountDownLatch once count is reaches to zero, this is the main
 * difference between CountDownLatch and CyclicBarrier, which is frequently
 * asked in core Java interviews and multi-threading interviews. 
 * 2) Main Thread
 * wait on Latch by calling CountDownLatch.await() method while other thread
 * calls CountDownLatch.countDown() to inform that they have completed.
